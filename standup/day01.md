# Standup Day 01

- Duncan showed us how to access Heroku logs from the CLI
- Duncan showed us his pageCreate pagination tool to eventually be used for 'infinite scroll'.

Right now, we're trying to get Heroku deployment to work for both frontend and backend.  Servers run locally but get some different errors on Heroku.
